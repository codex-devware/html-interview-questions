# Question 01. What is the difference between HTML and XHTML?

# Answer:

*HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard for structuring and presenting content on the web. It defines the document structure using tags and attributes.

*XHTML (eXtensible HyperText Markup Language) is a stricter version of HTML, ensuring valid XML syntax. While XHTML aimed to unify HTML with XML, HTML5 has addressed many of these concerns, making XHTML less common today.



# Question 02. Explain the difference between <h1>and <b>tags.

# Answer:

1.<h1>to <h6>tags define headings of varying importance, with <h1>being the most significant and <h6>the least. Headings structure the document content and improve accessibility for screen readers.

2.The <b>tag (bold) is a presentational tag that simply makes the text bold visually. However, it does not convey any semantic meaning about the content's importance. Modern practice favors semantic tags like <strong>for strong emphasis, as it indicates importance to search engines and screen readers.
